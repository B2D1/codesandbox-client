Since we announced Sandpack, we didn't stop a minute. We've been working hard alongside the community to improve it and make it even better. And to be honest, we're amazed how the community embraced Sandpack. As a result, many projects can now empower their users and provide a better code experience in their own project and website.

But today, we'd like to introduce a new step in the Sandpack journey. We listened to you, and we're very excited to introduce a major release of Sandpack, which takes into account many feature requests, a complete redesign, and a ton of improvements in the API.

### **What is Sandpack?**

Sandpack is a component toolkit that makes it possible to have interactive, live-running code editing experiences in the browser. It is the in-browser bundler that powers CodeSandbox that is now open source.

With Sandpack's live coding environment, you get:

- A full editor experience with syntax highlighting.
- An advanced preview that takes advantage of npm dependency support, hot module reloading, etc.
- One click away from opening your code snippets directly in CodeSandbox.

### One step back

The very first version of Sandpack was released in 2018. Since then, we haven't had the chance to take a step back and rethink how you interact with it and how the Sandpack components fit in your website. Plus, we realized that we need to be prepared for the future challenge that might come. That's why we recreated the surface API and the design of the components to open more opportunities for us, and you!

So, at the first look, all the breaking changes introduced in this major version might not look significant. But, they're crucial to keep us evolving the product and still keep it extensible, customizable, and easy to use.
